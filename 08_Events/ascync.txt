/*Javascript:- 
     =>Synchronous
     =>Single Threaded

Execution Context:- 
       => execute one time of code at a time
       console log-> 1
       console log-> 2
       =>each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing

Blocking code  -> Block the flow of program -> Read the Sync
Non Blocking code  -> Does not block execution -> Read file Async
